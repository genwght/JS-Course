// 1.    Ask the user to enter an email using prompt().
// 2.    Validate the email according to the following rules:
// â€¢    It cannot be empty or null.
// â€¢    It must contain @.
// â€¢    @ cannot be at the beginning.
// â€¢    @ cannot be at the end.
// â€¢    The total length must be greater than 5 characters.
// 3.    If the email does not meet any of these conditions, display the appropriate error message using document.write().
// 4.    Keep asking the user for a valid email until they enter a correct one.

// ðŸ“Œ Example Errors to Display:
// â€¢    "Error: Email cannot be empty."
// â€¢    "Error: Email must contain '@'."

// â€¢    "Error: '@' cannot be at the end of the email."
// â€¢    "Error: Email must be longer than 5 characters."

// ðŸ“Œ Requirements:
// â€¢    Use loops (while or do...while) to keep asking the user until they enter a valid email.
// â€¢    Use conditional statements to check for errors.
// â€¢    Display error messages using document.write().
// â€¢    Submit your work as a pull request (PR) on GitHub.
